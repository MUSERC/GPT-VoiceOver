# GPT-VoiceOver
This project is a basic Python application that uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate text from user prompts and then converts this text to speech using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech API. It's a straightforward tool for transforming written stories or descriptions into spoken words.

Key Features
Text Generation: Create text based on user input using OpenAI's GPT model.
Speech Synthesis: Convert the generated text into spoken audio with ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology.
Save Audio Locally: The generated speech can be saved as an MP3 file for later use.

How It Works
The user provides a prompt (like a story idea or topic).
The application uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate text based on the prompt.
The generated text is then converted into speech using ElevenLabs' API.
The user can save the speech as an audio file.

Technologies Used
Python: The script is written in Python.
OpenAI API: For generating text based on prompts.
ElevenLabs API: For converting text to speech
